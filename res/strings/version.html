<h1>EQ Picker Tool v.0.0.1</h1>

<p>A tool to perform event detection/picking over seismic signals.</p>

<p>Analysis can be performed in two ways: supervised or unsupervised mode.
In supervised mode the function graphs each of the candidate events
found and asks the user whether to accept them or not, whereas in
unsupervised mode the function just computes results without receiving
any feedback from users.</p>
